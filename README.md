# AI Search Engine

## This is an AI-based search and autocomplete engine that predicts user queries based on popular search patterns. The project will incorporate real-time filters for potentially defamatory or malicious suggestions. A user-feedback mechanism will allow quick review and removal of harmful autocompletes while maintaining transparency about how suggestions are generated.

## Architecture Overview

```
The AI-based search and autocomplete engine will be implemented using a Flask-based architecture with PostgreSQL as the database. The main components are organized as follows:

1. app.py: The main Flask application entry point that initializes the app, configures database connections using SQLAlchemy, and registers blueprints for different routes. It also handles the setup of CORS and other middleware.

2. models/search_model.py: Contains SQLAlchemy models for storing search patterns, user feedback, and autocomplete suggestions. Includes tables for SearchHistory, AutocompleteSuggestions, and UserFeedback, with appropriate relationships and indexes for efficient querying.

3. services/prediction_service.py: Implements the core AI logic using scikit-learn or TensorFlow for query prediction. This service processes historical search patterns, generates autocomplete suggestions, and applies real-time filtering using pre-trained models for content moderation.

4. controllers/search_controller.py: Handles HTTP requests and responses, manages the routing logic for search endpoints, and coordinates between the prediction service and database operations. Implements RESTful endpoints for search, autocomplete, and feedback submission.

5. utils/content_filter.py: Contains the implementation of real-time content filtering algorithms, including text analysis for potentially harmful or defamatory content. Utilizes natural language processing libraries like NLTK or spaCy.

The data flow begins when a user starts typing, triggering requests to the search controller, which then coordinates with the prediction service to generate suggestions. These suggestions are filtered through the content filter before being returned to the user. User feedback is stored in PostgreSQL through SQLAlchemy ORM, which is then used to improve the prediction model. Database connections are managed using connection pooling via SQLAlchemy, with configuration parameters stored in a separate config.py file.
