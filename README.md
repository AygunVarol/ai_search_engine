# AI Search Engine

## an AI-based search and autocomplete engine that predicts user queries based on popular search patterns. The project will incorporate real-time filters for potentially defamatory or malicious suggestions. A user-feedback mechanism will allow quick review and removal of harmful autocompletes while maintaining transparency about how suggestions are generated.

The AI-based search and autocomplete engine will be structured using a Flask-based architecture with the following key components:

1. app.py: The main Flask application entry point that initializes the server, configures routes, and sets up database connections using SQLAlchemy for PostgreSQL integration. It handles user authentication and API endpoints.

2. search_engine/predictor.py: Core module containing the AI prediction logic using TensorFlow or scikit-learn for query pattern analysis. Implements machine learning models to generate autocomplete suggestions based on historical search patterns and user behavior.

3. search_engine/filter.py: Houses the content filtering system that screens suggestions for potentially harmful or defamatory content using natural language processing techniques. Integrates with external content moderation APIs when needed.

4. models/search_data.py: Defines SQLAlchemy models for storing search queries, user feedback, and suggestion patterns. Includes tables for search history, blocked terms, and user feedback metrics.

5. services/feedback_handler.py: Manages the user feedback system, processing user reports and updating the suggestion algorithm accordingly. Implements a queue system for reviewing reported suggestions.

6. utils/database.py: Handles database connection pooling, query optimization, and maintenance tasks. Implements caching mechanisms using Redis for frequently accessed search patterns.

The application uses PostgreSQL for persistent storage of search patterns and feedback data, with Redis as a caching layer for improved performance. Data flows from user input through the prediction engine, passes through content filters, and is then served back to users. The feedback system continuously updates the ML models and filtering rules based on user interactions.
